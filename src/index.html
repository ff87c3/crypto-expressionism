            The abstraction of Jackson Pollock's drip painting style somehow evoked
            the chaotic yet structured movements of cryptocurrency markets. At first
            glance random, Pollock's art was guided by an underlying order, as
            gravity, paint viscosity, and his physical gestures all played a role in
            shaping the composition. Breaking away from representational art, the
            process itself became as important as the final work. Initially valued
            for its radicalism, his paintings quickly turned into investment
            opportunities, with their value reaching record highs in contemporary
            art and disconnecting from any intrinsic creative worth. Bitcoin was
            revolutionary in its own way. Born out of a desire for decentralized
            financial autonomy, transparency, and peer-to-peer transactions, it
            dematerialized the concept of currency to a new level. As a highly
            volatile asset, it didn't take long for it to lose its essence, becoming
            a perfect object of speculation. Although the visual representation of
            its price movements on the screen seems erratic, it is tightly linked to
            the rational flow of its transactions - a blend of order and chaos.

            Based on a conventional trading chart, the script draws from Bitcoin's
            price in real time, extracting it every minute and creating a stroke
            according to a specific pattern. This automated process saves the
            outcome in a database at midnight, archives it and resets the screen for
            the next day.

            Indirectly interactive, the digital canvases generated daily are
            collective works. Anyone participating in the buying and selling of the
            currency influences the final rendering.
